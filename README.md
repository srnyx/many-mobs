# Many Mobs

Adds a command to summon multiple mobs at once. Made this since it's not possible with Minecraft vanilla's `/summon`

**ChatGPT:** This Minecraft plugin provides server administrators with the ability to summon multiple mobs at once, improving server management and reducing the time needed to spawn mobs individually. Although the command is not intended for general player use, it offers valuable utility for server administrators who need to spawn groups of mobs efficiently. By simplifying the process of mob summoning, this plugin enhances server performance and helps ensure a smooth gameplay experience for all players.
